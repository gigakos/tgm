The Game Machine is a machine learning API that can be attached to games and learn how to play them using neural networks and genetic algorithms. This is currently a work in progress (and so is this README).

There are currently two examples with the project (both in java), the infamous 2048 and an infinite vertical platformer I made called BallJump.
